# Virtual Pentathlon
    # Final Project for CS: 219
    # Spring 2020
    # Professor Lee
# Description: choose values for 3 attributes of athletes (endurance, muscle %, and maximum speed) and compare them to robot competitors for 5 events
  # each attribute can have a maximum value of 10, and the total cannot add to greater than 20
    
# PentathlonApp file runs the other files and pulls up the interactive window to "compete"
# PentathlonPanel file creates the interactive window, and rankings for each event:
    # 100m hurdles, 400m, shot put, steeplechase, and long jump
    # each with different chance of tripping as well
# Athlete file creates standards for each event
    # robot competitors designed with various distances or times apart
    # if choose "best" attribute values for an event, get 1st place
# Die file used for random chance of tripping during event
